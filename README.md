# hldmodding

Python modding/value manipulation framework for Hyper Light Drifter

## Main things I want for now

- A GUI launcher where you can download and toggle mods
- Pre-launch executable patching (mainly for texture swapping)
- Pre-launch level patching
- Real time value manipulation based on hooks
